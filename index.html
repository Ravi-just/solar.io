        <h2>About Solar Tracking and Solar Energy</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Farmers Solar Hub, where we empower farmers with knowledge about
            solar energy and cutting-edge solar tracking systems. Solar tracking involves
            adjusting the position of solar panels to follow the sun's path, maximizing
            energy absorption and enhancing efficiency.

        <h2>Solar Energy for Sustainable Farming</h2>
        <p>
            Solar energy is a game-changer for sustainable farming. By harnessing the
            power of the sun, farmers can reduce their carbon footprint, lower energy
            costs, and achieve energy independence. Solar power is a clean, renewable
            resource that benefits both the environment and the farmer's bottom line.

        <h2>Solar Tracking Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Solar tracking systems play a crucial role in optimizing energy production.
            These systems automatically adjust the tilt and orientation of solar panels,
            ensuring they face the sun throughout the day. As a result, farmers can
            benefit from increased energy yield, especially during peak sunlight hours.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Solar Tracking Systems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-Axis Tracking:</strong> Follows the sun's path on one axis (usually east to west).</li>
            <li><strong>Dual-Axis Tracking:</strong> Adjusts panels on two axes, following both the sun's
            daily and seasonal movements.</li>
            <li><strong>MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking):</strong> Optimizes the electrical operating point of
            solar panels to maximize efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits of Solar Tracking for Farmers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased energy production</li>
            <li>Improved efficiency of solar panels</li>
            <li>Enhanced crop yields through precision irrigation</li>
            <li>Reduced reliance on non-renewable energy sources</li>
        </ul>
